Reflection: Sometimes things are easier than they seem, with little errors that you didnt see. For example, I had an underscore at the end of .md because that is what was in the directions. As soon as I removed the underscore, everything worked. Additionally, the naming of one of my directories was wrong creating issues. I also think I have some issues resulting from previous packages and environments that I have loaded in. 

Confusion:
I am still pretty confused as to why the code was not working in the first place. Even though I could actively see that I was in the correct directory and that the files existed, it did not want to work. However, after I restarted a few times, it eventually worked. Im not sure at what point something changed so that it worked.
